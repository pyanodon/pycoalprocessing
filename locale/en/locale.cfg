[map-gen-preset-description]
py-recommended=These are the recommend settings for playing Pyanodon mods without Resource Spawner Overhaul active. Resources patches are slightly smaller, very spaced out, and much richer.\nEnemies and pollution are disabled. Cliffs and water are lessened, slightly.
default=[color=red]This preset is not recommended for Pyanodon mods, consider using the [/color]Pyanodon recommended[color=red] preset from the dropdown above.[/color]

shot=Edible

[messages]
welcome=Welcome to Pyanodon! Remember to check the Pyanodon Codex (button in the top left) for details on the gameplay.
warning-no-preset=It looks like you are not using the '__1__' map generation preset. Initial ore patches may run out quickly, but this is otherwise playable.
warning-biters=It looks like you have biters enabled. Pyanodon is not yet balanced with biters, the recommendation is to turn them off.
warning-quality=The quality mod has been enabled. This is only supported insofar that it loads and you can use it. It is absolutely unbalanced however, so it is not recommended to play Py with it turned on. The recycler in particular is comically unbalanced and should never be used.
