  Pycodex:
    - Fixed pycodex search (https://github.com/pyanodon/pybugreports/issues/370)

  Tailings pond:
    - Tailings pond spillage event is slightly more dramatic.

    - Fixed constant redraws of the tailings pond fluid sprite
    - To give that nice authentic oil spill experience: Tailings pond pollution tiles will now burn for way longer (hours)
    - Added purest-nitrogen-gas, hot air, pressurized air, vacuum, and neon to the non polluting gasses list.
    - Fixed graphical error when polluted tiles were placed next to burnt polluted tiles

  Beacons:
    - INFO: The following 2 changes are toggleable in the mod settings.
    - Changed the beacon interference criteria from requiring the exact same AM and FM frequencies to instead requiring either overlapping AM or FM. This effectively reduces the max number of beacons per entity from 25 to 5.
    - Nerfed beacon (not diet beacon) transmission efficiency from 0.5*am*fm to 0.2*am*fm. This helps prevent the insane cases of +65536% speed that were possible previously and also fixes the bug that full beacons were 2.5X more energy efficent than diet beacons.
    - If two beacons interfere on a single entity, it will now only disable that entity instead of disabling the entire beacon.
    - Fixed that you could stack 25 diet beacons with 25 regular beacons for 50 total.
    - Fixed certian exploits where you could get around the interference mechanic
